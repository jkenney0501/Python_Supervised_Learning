# Python_Supervised_Learning

This repo is still being developed. Some small projects are done as an example but mostly as a reference for fundamentals. As time permits, more models will be added and complexity will grow within the various projects.

Coming Soon: Section on hyperparameter tuning! 

## Linear Regression

- [Housing Prices (Psuedo Data)](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/LinearRegression/Base%20Examples/Housing%20Intro%20Example%20for%20-LR/1.Linear_Regression.1.1-Psuedo%20Housing%20Data.ipynb)
  - Purpose of this example is to layout a simplified appraoch to LM modeling.

- [eCommerce LM Mini Project (Psuedo Data)](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/LinearRegression/Base%20Examples/eCommerce%20w-LinearRegression/02-Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)
  - This Linear Regression model explores the variables associated with webiste sessions compared to mobile sessions to predict annual spending amounts from customers. 



## Logistic Regression - To be completed sometime this year (credit default LR)! This is a rather extensive project. Last update on 2/21/2022
- Credit Default: A Logistic Regression Analysis of customer credit card/default behavior.
    - [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/LogisticRegression-CreditDefault/NoteBooks/Data%20Exploration%20and%20Cleaning.ipynb)

    - [Model Evaluation](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/LogisticRegression-CreditDefault/NoteBooks/Model%20Evaluation%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

- [Titanic Survival Predictions Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Classification%20Examples/Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Titanic%20Survival%20Classification.ipynb)
  - This model is a foundational example of exploring the data, cleaning, training, predicting and evaluating metrics.
  
- [Adversting Predcitions Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Classification%20Examples/Logistic%20Regression-Advertising%20Predictions.ipynb)
   - A foundational example of building a logistic regression model used to predict if a customer clicked on an advertisment based on selected features.

## K Nearest Neigbors
  - [Anonymous Classification](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Example.ipynb)
    - This example provides the base algorithm use case and an optimization for error rate using the elbow method for K.

  - [Anonymous Classification Project](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb)
    - Same as the example classification above but with a larger and different anonymous data set. The concepts covered are menat to strengthen the fundamental task of using and optimizing the model.

## Decision Trees & Random Forrests
  - [Kyphosis Decision Tree](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests/Decision%20Trees.ipynb)
    - This example uses a decision tree to analyze patients that had undergone an operation for a spinal condition called Kyphosis. The decision tree is used to predict whether or not a patitent was healed several months post op. 

  - [Lending Tree Decision Tree/RF Analysis (real data)](https://github.com/jkenney0501/Python_Supervised_Learning/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project.ipynb)
    - This analysis completes an exploratory analysis, tests a decision tree and compares the results to a random forest using the same data. All data is real data from leanding tree circa 2010ish.
